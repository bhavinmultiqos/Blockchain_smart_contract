#  Technology Stack
The following technologies were used in this project:

MetaMask: A browser extension that allows users to manage their Ethereum wallet and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) directly from the browser.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications. Itâ€™s used to run the development server and handle dependencies.
Ganache: Personal blockchain for Ethereum development used for local testing. You can use Ganache to deploy contracts and test transactions on a local network.


# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
